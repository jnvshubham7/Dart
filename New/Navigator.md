In Flutter, navigation between screens or pages is handled using the `Navigator` widget, which manages a stack of pages and provides methods to navigate to a new page or return to the previous one. Here's a brief overview of how to use the `Navigator` for navigation:

### Basic Navigation

1. **Navigating to a new screen:**

   ```dart
   Navigator.push(
     context,
     MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => SecondScreen()),
   );
   ```

   This code snippet pushes a new route (or screen) onto the stack, which effectively navigates to the `SecondScreen`.
2. **Returning from a screen:**

   ```dart
   Navigator.pop(context);
   ```

   This will pop the current route off the stack and return to the previous screen.

### Passing Data Between Screens

1. **Passing data to a new screen:**

   ```dart
   Navigator.push(
     context,
     MaterialPageRoute(
       builder: (context) => SecondScreen(data: 'Hello'),
     ),
   );
   ```

   In this case, you are passing the string `'Hello'` to the `SecondScreen`.
2. **Receiving data back from a screen:**

   ```dart
   final result = await Navigator.push(
     context,
     MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => SecondScreen()),
   );
   ```

   You can then use the `result` variable to access the data returned from the `SecondScreen`.

   On the second screen, you can return data like this:

   ```dart
   Navigator.pop(context, 'Goodbye');
   ```

### Named Routes

1. **Defining named routes:**

   ```dart
   MaterialApp(
     initialRoute: '/',
     routes: {
       '/': (context) => FirstScreen(),
       '/second': (context) => SecondScreen(),
     },
   );
   ```

   Here, two routes are defined: `'/'` for the `FirstScreen` and `'/second'` for the `SecondScreen`.
2. **Navigating using named routes:**

   ```dart
   Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/second');
   ```

   This will navigate to the `SecondScreen` using the named route.

### Using `Navigator` for Advanced Navigation

- **Pushing a screen and removing all previous screens (replacing the entire stack):**

  ```dart
  Navigator.pushAndRemoveUntil(
    context,
    MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => SecondScreen()),
    (route) => false,
  );
  ```

  This is useful for cases like after a login screen, where you don't want the user to go back to the login screen after they've logged in.
- **Replacing the current screen with a new one:**

  ```dart
  Navigator.pushReplacement(
    context,
    MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => SecondScreen()),
  );
  ```

This provides a foundation for navigation in Flutter. Depending on your app's complexity, you might explore more advanced navigation techniques, like using the `Navigator 2.0` API or integrating a state management solution.
